# Super Mario Bros 2 ANN Disassembly

This disassembly is based off of Doppelganger's fantastic work with the SMB 2J diassembly: https://www.romhacking.net/documents/653/

In the source there are a series of ".ifdef ANN"'s, which show the parts that are added, moved and removed between ANN and SMB2j.

## Building

To compile, make sure you have cc65 and make installed in a bash terminal. Then just write 'make' to create the FDS rom.

Enjoy!
